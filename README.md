With the aim of decarbonizing the entire aviation sector by 2050, as prescribed by numerous studies, it is necessary to address all areas, however little they pollute. Thus, for the manufacturing industry, it was decided to calculate its impact on the environment through 3 indicators: GHG emissions, energy consumption and waste generation. The goal is to evaluate the reduction of these indicators through different methods by improving the efficiency of production means or materials. The results show more or less significant reductions depending on the method used. However, the maturity of these methods and their ability to be deployed to meet the needs of the sector must be taken into account.
